Recursion : There are two ways we can represent this,  1 is stack and other one is Tree model

f(n)  = (2power(n+1)) -1  = f(2) = 2power 2+1 = 8 -1 = 7

If you have more recursion functions then traversing will be easy on Trees
Tree recursion traversing always from Top --to--> left --to--> Right

Instruction pointer - where it will be get's called from the stack

Towers of Hanoi :

in-order to move n d isks from x to y using z -->


Permutation : npr = n!/(n-r)!
