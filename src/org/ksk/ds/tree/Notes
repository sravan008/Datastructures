Tree terminology :

        Tree's are Hierarchical not a liner DS like stacks, queues and Array's
        Tree is a DS which made up of lots of nodes, each node point to a Number of nodes, not a just one
        There is no order tree can maintain, its not a imp though
        Tree is typically used to represent hierarchical information
        A general tree DS can have any number of children but these tress are less useful and not very commonly used as a DS- It is not widely used
        Binary tree - in a binary tree each node can have 0,1,2 children
                                                                                                                                 A
                                                                                                                                / \
        Root Node - Parent node - A                                                                                            B   C
        Edge - A link from parent node to child node                                                                              / \
        Leaf - A node with no children    - F H G                                                                                D   E
        Sibling node : Node which are at same level                                                                             / \   \
                                                                                                                               F   H   G

        C is a ancestor of F
        F is a descendent of C
        A is a root node also a ancestor for all it's decendent nodes
